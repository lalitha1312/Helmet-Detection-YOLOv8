# Helmet-Detection-YOLOv8
Real-time helmet detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

🪖 Helmet Detection Using YOLOv8

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project is designed to detect whether a person riding a two-wheeler is wearing a helmet or not in real-time. It uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) for object detection and OpenCV for processing video input. This system can be applied in traffic surveillance, public safety enforcement, and smart city monitoring.


TOOL & TECH:
Python - Programming Language
YOLOv8 - Object Detection Model
OpenCV - Frame Processing & Display
Webcam/Video - Real-time input feed


WORKING: 
1. Load YOLOv8 Model
2. Read Frames from Webcam/Video
3. Detect Objects
4. Analyze Detections
5. Display Output


USE CASES:
Smart traffic enforcement
Smart city surveillance
Safety compliance checks
