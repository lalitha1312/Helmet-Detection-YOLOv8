# Helmet-Detection-YOLOv8
Real-time helmet detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

🪖 Helmet Detection Using YOLOv8

📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to detect whether a person riding a two-wheeler is wearing a helmet or not in real-time. It uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) for object detection and OpenCV for processing video input. This system can be applied in traffic surveillance, public safety enforcement, and smart city monitoring.

🧠 Tools & Technologies

Python - Programming Language

YOLOv8 - Object Detection Model

OpenCV - Frame Processing & Display

Webcam/Video - Real-time input feed
